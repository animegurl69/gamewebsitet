Okay let's figure out how to get bootstrap working. 

It turns out we were reading the documentation for bootstrap v4, and installed v5 and that caused the error.

TODO:

1) First delete the bootstrap node mudule in terminal: 'npm uninstall bootstrap'

2) Follow the documentation https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ and embed bootstrap modules in your project.

    bootstrap is divided into two parts: css and javascript. Both needs to be imported within the index.html file.

    a) css: defines the styles of bootstrap. Remember the "calssName=navbar" tag? navbar is a bootstrap css class. 

    b) javascript: defines the actions of bootstrap. This can be found when you click the expand button on the navbar.

3) Follow the documentation https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/ to implement navbar
